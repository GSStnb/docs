History
-------

**LibreCAD** is a **free Open Source** 2D CAD application using the cross-platform framework Qt.  That means it works with multiple operating systems; Windows, Apple and Linux. 

The project started around 2010 as a fork of QCAD 2.0.5.0. It began as a project to build CAM capabilities into the community version of QCAD for use with a Mechmate CNC router.  This gave rise to CADuntu.  The project was known as CADuntu only for a couple of months before the community decided that the name was inappropriate.  After some discussion within the community and research on existing names, CADuntu was renamed to **LibreCAD**.

Since QCAD CE was built around the outdated Qt3 library, it had to be ported to Qt4 before additional enhancements.  Porting the rendering engine to Qt4 proved to be a large task, so initially LibreCAD, the 1.0.0 series, still depended on the Qt3 support library. Thanks to our master developer Rallaz, the Qt4 porting was completed during the development of 2.0.0 series and LibreCAD has become Qt3 free.  The latest version of LibreCAD, the 2.2.0 series, requires the Qt5 framework.

The User Manual
---------------

The user manual is a compilation from many sources. It includes the technical descriptions of the tools, functions, widgets, etc. in the Reference section and a generic instructions on how to do a few things with LibreCAD in the User Guide section. There is also further information and examples of the LibreCAD’s features in the appendices.

The manual is best viewed with a screen width of 768 to 1152 pixels. Clicking the “LibreCAD” text or icon at the top of the menu will return to the User Manual’s home page. On smaller devices, 768 pixels or less, the menu is hidden and can be made visible by clicking the “hamburger” icon. Clicking the “LibreCAD” text top of the window will return to the home page.

This manual uses screen captures of LibreCAD installed on Linux. While the images may appear slightly different on Windows or MacOS, the application layout and menu commands will be the same.
