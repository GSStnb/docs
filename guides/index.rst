User Guides
===========

The user guides provide examples of a variety of tasks performed with LibreCAD.  The tasks are generic in the sense that they can be applied to any drawing.  The examples provided in the guides build on the previous examples and when complete will provide a finished drawing that uses many of LibreCAD's features.

The example drawings in the **User Guides** use LibreCAD's default configuration with the exception of the drawing window's background color.  It has been changed to light grey (#e6e6e6) in **Options -> Application Preferences -> Appearances** tab, "Background" color under "Graphic Colors.
