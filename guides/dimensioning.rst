Dimensioning
============

Dimensions are used to define length, width, height of a line entity, or the diameter of circle entity or radius of arc entity.  Types of dimensioning include:
   - Linear
   - Aligned
   - Vertical and horizontal
   - Angular
   - Radius / Diameter
   - Reference

Other than "Reference", each of the type of dimension have a corresponding dimension :ref:`tool <tools>`.  A reference dimension can be of any type, but not used to to define an entity.  It might be for information purposes only or  an accumulation of other dimensions, etc.  The text for a reference dimension is typically enclosed in parentheses ().


Rules of Dimensioning
---------------------

Each dimension should be written clearly with only one way to be interpreted.
4. There is no need to calculate, scale, or assume any dimension to define or check features of the object.
Enough space should be provided to avoid crowding and misinterpretation.
5. Dimensions are related to the view that best shows the features being dimensioned.
Each entity should be dimensioned and dimensioned only once.
Dimensions should be placed outside the part.
6. Multiple rows of dimensions are spaced uniformly, with at least 1/4” between rows and 3/8” from views.
Place dimensions outside of the views except for large circles.  Keep dimensions at least 3/8 inches or 10 mm from the view.
10. Place longer dimensions outside of shorter ones.
7. Longer dimensions are placed outside shorter ones so that witness lines do not cross dimension lines.
11. Place the dimension text between the dimension lines.
Dimension and extension lines should not cross.
12. Use arrow heads at the end of the dimension lines.
Dimension features or surfaces should be done to a logical reference point.
Circles should be dimensioned with diameters and arcs with a radius.
Center lines or marks should be used on all circles and holes.
A center line should be extended and used as an extension line.
Extension lines and object lines should not overlap.
