.. _draw:

Drawing geometric shapes, or *entities* is familiar to many people that have used drawing and paint programs, but CAD (Computer Aided Drafting) offers greater precision and other advantages over the other types of programs.  Be sure to reads through the **Reference** section, particularily the :ref:`Fundamentals <fundamentals>` and the :ref:`Drawing Tools <tools>` sections to obtain an understanding of the basic operation of LibreCAD. 


Creating Entities
=================

Creating new geometric entities all use similar methods.  Generally,  creating an entity requires placement of a minimum of two points (Well, unless the entity being drawn is a point), or a single point and an additional parameter such as length or radius.  In some case the same result can be obtained using a few different methods.  For example, drawing a line can be done by defining two points using the line drawing tool
