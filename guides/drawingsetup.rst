Setting up a Drawing
====================

Under normal circumstances, after the initial installation and :ref:`configuration <configure>`, little if any configuration needs to done to be able to start drawing.  There are a couple of important things to keep in mind:

    1. Drawings should be created full-scale (1:1).  Let the software worry about making it fit in the display window!
    2. Producing output, on the other hand, does need to be scaled to fit.  Generally output is a printed page, but it can also be a pdf, or :ref:`exported to another image format <file>`.

These two points contradict each other, but that contradiction is easily addressed when the drawing is ready to :ref:`print <printing-guide>`.

During the initial setup, a default :ref:`unit of measure <measurements>` was set (defaults to millimeter).  That default should be the unit of measure most frequently used as it is used for **all** new drawings, however it can be changed in the :ref:`Application Preferences <app-prefs>`.

There are a many other drawing parameters that need to be considered to suit the drawing requirements, most of those being related to the output / printing.  All the settings are found in the :ref:`Drawing Preferences <draw-prefs>`.  The vast majority of these setting can be left as the defaults as those defaults reflect generally accepted drafting standards.  Two of the tabs, *Paper* and *Dimensions* require particular attention.  The setting on these two tabs affect the output, and there are specific parameters that are the most important:

    1. "Paper format" on the *Paper* tab: Selecting a paper size and orientation will determine the scale used for final output.  It also used to determine the "General Scale". 
    2. "General Scale" on the *Dimensions* tab:
