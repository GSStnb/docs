.. _preview:

Print Preview
-------------

The **Print Preview** toolbar enables to set the print output up as desired regardless of output format (pdf or paper). The print view can be configured after selecting **File -> Print Preview** through the menu. A combination of scale value, color status and drawing position relative to paper allows customed print output. The steps are detailed in :ref:`printing guide <printing>`.

 .. important::
    You cannot set the print output up with the menus nor by typing commands. Please make sure the *Tool Option* toolbar is visible.
