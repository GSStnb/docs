 .. important::
    Print Preview and Block operations require the use of the **Tool Options** toolbar as the are no menu or command line equivalency. Ensure the Tool Option toolbar is visible (**widgets -> Toolbars**, check **Tool Options**).

.. _preview:

Print Preview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Print Preview** toolbar enables to set the print output up as desired regardless of output format (pdf or paper). The print view can be configured after selecting **File -> Print Preview** through the menu. A combination of scale value, color status and drawing position relative to paper allows customed print output. The steps are detailed in :ref:`printing guide <printing>`.
