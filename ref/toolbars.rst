Other Toolbars
--------------

 .. important::
    Print Preview and Block operations require the use of the **Tool Options** toolbar as there are no menu or command line equivalencies. Ensure the Tool Option toolbar is enabled (**Widgets -> Toolbars** and check **Tool Options**).


.. _print-preview-toolopt:

Print Preview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Print Preview** toolbar is used to set up the print output as desired regardless of output format (pdf or paper). The print preview can be configured after selecting **File -> Print Preview** through the menu.  A combination of scale value, color status and drawing position relative to paper allows customed print output. The steps are detailed in :ref:`printing guide <printing-guide>`.

Inserting Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two block insert operations with corresponding Tool Option toolbars.  For further details on using blocks refer to :ref:`Blocks <blocks>` in the User Guides.


From Block List
```````````````

The **Block Insert** capability can be expanded through the *Tool Option* bar features before the block is inserted.

    "Option Item", "Description"
    "Angle", "Defines the angle of rotation, if any. See :ref:`Angles in LibreCAD <fundamentals>`."
    "Factor", "Defines the scale factor, if any. It is the same scale factor as in :ref:`Modify <tools>`."
    "Array", "Defines the numbers of columns and rows to create a pattern of selected block. Otherwise keep 1 for columns and rows."
    "Spacing", "Defines the distance between each column of the array and the distance between each row. The distance is measured between 2 insertion points of 2 adjacent blocks."


From Block Library
``````````````````

Inserting a block from a library can be enhanced through the *Tool Option* bar features before the block is inserted.
