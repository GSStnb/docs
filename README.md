This is the **LibreCAD User Manual** documentation source repository.  The manual can be read online at https://librecad.readthedocs.io/ (or downloaded in PDF or ePub formats). The repository will contain multiple versions of the manual corresponding with each release of LibreCAD.

The documentation is created using a markup language called "reStructuredText" (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).  For those interested in contributing to the documentation, refer to the documentation wiki (https://github.com/LibreCAD/docs/wiki) and **LibreCAD-doc** on the LibreCAD forum (http://forum.librecad.org/).
